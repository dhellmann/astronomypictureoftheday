==================================
 Astronomy Picture of the Day 3.3
==================================

The AstronomyPictureOfTheDay_ desktop wallpaper updater is a Mac OS X application
that downloads the latest image from the `Astronomy Picture of the Day site`_ and sets 
it as your desktop background. It can be run by hand, or installed to run automatically 
through iCal.

What's New in this Release?
===========================

This version fixes a problem with APOD pages that link to multiple images 
so that only the main image on the page is downloaded.
